# Chat App Project

This is a mini project in the State Management chapter of Udacity's React Fundamentals course. In the Chat App project, build a React app that shows 2 chat windows for the
two existing users - Rock and Hart.
The messages they send to each other should
appear in both chat windows. On Rock's screen, his messages should appear in green and
Hart's messages should appear in blue. On Hart's screen, his messages should appear in
green and Rock's messages should appear in blue.

## TL;DR
